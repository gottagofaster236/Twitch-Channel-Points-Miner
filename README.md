# Twitch Channel Points Miner

# Note
### I'm not actively developing this repo. You can use the enhanced fork: https://github.com/Tkd-Alex/Twitch-Channel-Points-Miner-v2

A simple script that will watch a stream for you and earn the channel points.

It can wait for a streamer to go live (+_450 points_ when the stream starts),
it will automatically click the bonus button (_+50 points_),
and it will follow raids (_+250 points_).

To run it, you first have to:

1) [Download Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
2) Install the dependencies. Run these two commands in the command line:<br>
`cd C:/path/to/directory/with/program/`<br>
`pip3 install -r requirements.txt`<br>


Then you can run `main.py`
